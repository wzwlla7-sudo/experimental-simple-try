# experimental-simple-try

A minimal communication app built with Python's socket library.

Designed as a stupid prototype for learning and testing basic network communication.  
No complex setup required — 
to run as client , download encrypt.C and main1_client.py and executeclient.bat then run executeclient.bat
to run the server , run encrypt.C then run main1_1 .
always downlad executabledecoding.py.
always open the server before the client
